# Rickys Work-Day-Scheduler

## Description

This work day scheduler is a easy and very useful app to use when needing to plan your work day. It has working hours from 9am-5pm with time slots where you can place in your events, as you save they will be saved to the page or you can hit reset to get rid of all the data youve placed. 

## Usage

When using the scheduler you are prompted with the time at the top with the hour as well, you will type in the events that you have planned in the text boxes provided and they are color coated for the times of the day, if it is green then that means that is in the future, if its red it means its in the past and otherwise it means its the present. Once you click save, you data will be saved to the page regardless if you reload or not, you are also given a reset button that will allow you to reset all the storage data and reload the page so youre given a clean sheet.

There are time blocks where you can write in what you have planned and if you click save it will save it into local storage and keep it on the page until you hit that reset button.
